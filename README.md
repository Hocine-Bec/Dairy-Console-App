# Personal Diary Console Application

## Project Overview
A console-based personal diary application was developed to practice object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in C#.

## Features
- Create new diary entries
- View all entries
- Update existing entries
- Delete entries
- Search for specific entries

## Technologies
- Language: C#
- Paradigm: Object-Oriented Programming
- File Management: Text-based storage

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open in Visual Studio
3. Build the solution
4. Run the application
5. Follow the on-screen menu options

## Project Structure
- `FileManager.cs`: Handles file I/O operations
- `EntryRepository.cs`: Manages journal entries
- `JournalEntry.cs`: Defines entry structure
- `JournalApp.cs`: Main application logic

## Learning Outcomes
During this project, I practiced:
- OOP design principles
- File handling
- User input validation
- Console application development

## Potential Future Improvements
- Replace File Operations With SQL Server Database
- Implement more robust error handling
